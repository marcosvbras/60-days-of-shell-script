## What is this?

**60 Days Of Shell Script** is inspired in [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) initiative and [60 Days Of Go](https://github.com/cassiobotaro/60-days-of-go) repository, where I learn something new about Shell Script every day during 60 days.

This project is a piece of a series called **X Days Of Something**, which one includes:
-   [100 Days Of Python](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-python)
-   [100 Days Of Ruby](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-ruby)
-   [100 Days Of Kotlin](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-kotlin)
-   [100 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/marcosvbras/100-days-of-swift)

## Why am I doing this? Why Shell Script?

Writing code that works is easy (most of the time). But writing efficient, clear, concise, scalable, and maintainable code is very difficult. It may be better with a lot of practice in various types of problems and paradigms, in addition to having mastery of the language you are coding.

With **Shell Script** I can find ways to simplify my life. As a developer, it is natural to want automate things, this is our job, right?

So, **let's code**?
